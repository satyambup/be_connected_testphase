        <p>With the comprehensive shut-down of schools and facilities to exercise social distancing, students are forced to stay at home for an indeterminate amount of time. How do we ensure that learning does not stop for them? Remote education is paramount in ensuring that our students keep learning.</p>

          <p>So, our approach to this issue in this time of need is quite easy as well as very feasible. Our idea revolves around creating something identical to the normal classes but it's virtual.</p>
          
          <p>Now here is the question of how we do it? As there are a lot of hurdles we have to cross to implement this, so here it goes:-</p>
          
         <p> We will be creating a pathway between University/college/school etc. and students using their timetable or daily schedule of their classes and their respective time in University/college/school etc.
          </p>

          <p><span>Problem related to remote education:-</span></p>
          <p>1.Not having an internet connection</p>
          <p>2.Not everyone has a laptop</p>
          <p>3.What about younger students and working parents</p>
          <p><span>our solution:-</span></p>
          <p>1. It's quite common that not everyone has high-speed internet connectivity or a large amount of data to continue. So in this case what do we do is we contact to different internet provider company around and strike a deal with them to provide free internet connectivity to the students during the class hour, the amount will be paid by institutions which can further be managed in school fees. 
          </p>
          <p>How is it done? We provide the company with students' mobile number on which free internet connectivity will be provided by the company. And the company provides the required internet and we are good to go.
          </p>
          <p>2. Not everyone has a laptop! So we will be making it mobile friendly as well.</p>
          <p>3. It's a bit harder for younger students to make them follow this and it's harder if both parents are working parents.
            So in this case we will be training parents on how to use this platform as well as we will have to reschedule the class timing according to the parents, which will be quite tough to make a uniform decision.</p>
            <p>And to make the younger students interact more and more we will Providing them with different activities to keep them engaged.</p>

            <p><span>Compulsory regulation or rules which will be followed for students:-
            </span></p>
            <p>.The students will be not be allowed to change their name or profile picture at any instance, to maintain the decorum of the class. It can only be changed by the institution.</p>
             <p> .The students will previously be muted and if they have asked some questions, there will be an option to raise hand virtually. On doing so the teacher will be informed about these and only the teacher can unmute you. This is done so that any students Can't disturb the class by making noise.</p>
             <p> .The students will have to put their cameras on always to make sure that they are present during the whole time of the class.</p>
              <p>.The student will be given an extra time of +5 minutes to join the class i.e- predefined time + 5 minutes (for example if the class starts at 9 am then the student can join latest by 9:05 am) to join the class after which they will mark absent or they can attend class but won't get attendance.
              </p>
              <p><span>Compulsory regulation or rules which will be followed for institutions:-</span></p>
              <P>If any particular teacher is absent then it has to be informed or another teacher is assigned and has to be notified to us for no service interruption.</P>
