Remote Education

With the comprehensive shut-down of schools and facilities to exercise social distancing, students are forced to stay at home for an indeterminate amount of time. How do we ensure that learning does not stop for them? Remote education is paramount in ensuring that our students keep learning.

So, our approach to this issue in this time of need is quite an easy as well as very feasible. Our idea revolves around around creating something that is identical to the normal classes but its virtual.

Now here is the question how we do it? As there are a lot of hurdles we have to cross to implement this, so here it goes:-

We will be creating a pathway between University/college/school etc. and students using their timetable or daily schedule of their classes and their respective time in University/college/school etc.

Explanation

We all have a schedule or timetable (link:--https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FJXwG0T5Cjl2M-pcHRvzL2rYJXw076We/view?usp=sharing)

We will acting as middle man between the students and their respective institution. We are going connect the institution database to the our website and when students open our website they will popped up with login screen, which will contain a drop down list of institutions connected with us. And when they proceed with their institution then a login id/registration id/ roll no and password will be required (which will be same as their institution’s ERP credentials, if it has one).

If the institution doesn’t have an ERP system running then they have to create one or look for something similar or we can provide them.

Now, when they fill their credentials and proceed then they will be redirected tooth page where their schedule or timetable will be visible to them as above.

This website will abide by each and every principals of an institution i.e:- class will start on predefined time and end on predefined time. And attendance will marked based on students presence during the class.

Now, when you see the above picture you click on the respective time and subject (for example:- my class starts at 8:30 am and my first subject is mathematics so I will choose this particular field and as soon as we click, we will be redirected to a virtual classroom where teachers will taking classes as usual.

So this will be followed for each and every students.

This is our approach handling this issue in this time of need.

But, now you think what’s the difference between my approach and already occurring approach.

Please follow us below.

Problem related to remote education:- 1.Not having an internet connection 2.Not everyone has a laptop 3.What about younger students and working parents

Solutions:-

1.Its quite common that not everyone has a high speed internet connectivity or large amount data to continue. So in this case what do we do is we contact to different internet provider company around and strike a deal with them to provide free internet connectivity to the students during the class hour, amount will be paid by institutions which can further be managed in school fees. . How is it done? We provide the company with students mobile number on which free internet connectivity will be provided by the company. And company provides the required internet and we are good to go.

2.Not everyone has a laptop! So we will be making it mobile friendly as well.

3.Its a bit harder for younger students to make them follow this and its more harder if both parents are working parents. So in this case we will be training parents on how to use this platform as well as we will have to reschedule the class timing as according the parents, which will be quite tough to make a uniform decision. And to make the younger students interact more and more we will Providing them with different activities to keep them engaged.

Extra features:- 1.Teachers can also put up assignment as well quizzes on the website and student can access it and has to submit the above before predefined time and date by the teachers. 2.If the institutions wants to host any Webinar by some personality for some students or classes then this can be also be done using this website.

So lets understand everything through an example:-

So, I am student from ABC public school. My class starts at 9:00 am. I go on to website and choose my school name and login using provided credentials by the school and login.

Now I am on to a page which shows my timetable and choose the respected subject according to time mentioned on my time-table/schedule and click on it, we are redirected to a virtual classroom where we be follow the class.

Compulsory regulation or rules which will be followed for students:-

1.The students will be not be allowed to change their name or profile picture at any instance, to maintain the decorum of the class. It can only be changed by institution.

2.The students will previously be muted and if they have ask some question, there will be an option to raise hand virtually. On doing so teacher will be informed about these and only teacher can unmute you. This is done so that any students Can’t disturb the class by making noise.

3.The students will have to put their camera on always to make sure that they are present during the whole time of class.

4.Student will be given an extra time of +5 minutes to join the class i.e- predefined time + 5 minutes (for example if class starts at 9 am then student can join latest by 9:05 am) to join the class after which they will marked absent or they can attend class but won’t get attendance.

Compulsory regulation or rules which will be followed for institutions:- .If any particular teacher is absent then it has to be informed or another teacher is assigned and has to be notified to us for no service interruption.
